                        <h2>Our History</h2>
                        <p>Founded in 1995 by art enthusiasts Margaret Collins and Robert Kim, <strong>The Modern Frame</strong> began as a small exhibition space in the heart of the Creative District. What started as a passion project has evolved into one of the city's most respected contemporary art venues.</p>
                        
                        <p>Our mission has always been to <em>bridge the gap between emerging artists and established collectors</em>, providing a platform where innovative artistic expression can flourish. Over nearly three decades, we have showcased over 300 exhibitions and supported more than 150 artists in their creative journeys.</p>
                        
                        <p>The gallery relocated to its current 5,000 square foot space in 2010, featuring state-of-the-art lighting systems and climate-controlled environments designed to showcase artwork in optimal conditions.</p>
